### Rapid focus position detection in satellite electro-optical payloads using fully convolutional networks

Optics Express · Nov 18, 2024

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopg%2Eoptica%2Eorg%2Foe%2Ffulltext%2Ecfm%3Furi%3Doe-32-25-43947%26id%3D563596&urlhash=PuTf&isSdui=true)

This study proposes a deep learning-based fast-focus detection network (FFDNet) to rapidly and accurately identify the optimal focus position throughout the entire assembly process of satellite electro-optical payloads. Built on a fully convolutional network architecture, FFDNet offers flexibility in predicting the focus positions, regardless of the input image size. It is characterized by rapid prediction speed, high accuracy, and robustness against external environmental noise. To address issues such as the excessive measurement time and sensitivity to environmental conditions found in existing algorithms, we trained FFDNet using knife-edge target images captured by a push-broom sensor. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FFDNet outperforms existing algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy and operates robustly under various temperature conditions and microvibration environments.

### Enhancing stability in Zernike coefficient computation through deep learning for polygonal mirrors of electro-optical satellite payloads

Proc. SPIE 13200, Electro-Optical and Infrared Systems: Technology and Applications XXI, 132001U · Nov 1, 2024

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1117%2F12%2E3033855&urlhash=Lvrq&isSdui=true)

In this study, we analyze the stability of Zernike coefficient computation using deep learning techniques and propose a new training method for deep learning model that can reliably output higher-order Zernike coefficients. Previous studies have shown that deep learning is a powerful tool for accurately deriving the Zernike coefficients of polygonal mirrors, but reliably extracting higher-order Zernike coefficients remains one of the challenges. To overcome these challenges, we present a new training method for the stability of deep learning model, enabling reliable high-order Zernike coefficient computation. The proposed deep learning model is designed based on the Network-in-Network concept, and a two-stage training process ensures that low-order and high-order Zernike coefficients are simultaneously reliably generated. Experimental results for performance evaluation show that the proposed deep learning model is effective in outputting stable and reliable higher-order Zernike coefficients, especially for polygonal mirrors.

### ZernikeNet: a deep learning-based approach for accurate Zernike coefficients calculation in aspheric optical components

SPIE ASTRONOMICAL OPTICS: DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND TEST OF SPACE AND GROUND SYSTEMS IV · Oct 4, 2023

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Espiedigitallibrary%2Eorg%2Fconference-proceedings-of-spie%2F12677%2F126770S%2FZernikeNet--a-deep-learning-based-approach-for-accurate-Zernike%2F10%2E1117%2F12%2E2676626%2Eshort%3FSSO%3D1&urlhash=QQFD&isSdui=true)

This paper presents a new method called ZernikeNet for accurately calculating Zernike coefficients in aspheric optical components. Surface figure error (SFE) measurements obtained using interferometer often include alignment errors and low-order aberrations, such as piston, tip, tilt, and defocus, which need to be removed to effectively analyze high-order aberrations. The traditional method for removing low-order aberrations involves Zernike polynomial fitting to the SFE, but this assumes that the optical component is circular and can be decomposed into an orthogonal basis set of Zernike polynomials. However, for aspheric optical components, the orthogonality of Zernike polynomials may not hold, making it challenging to accurately represent the SFE. To address this challenge, ZernikeNet employs a deep learning-based approach, where interferometer map of the optical component is fed into a multi-layer neural network structure to output a set of 36 Zernike coefficients. The proposed deep learning network is trained using a single-shot metrology approach, where a single input interferometer map is used to generate high-accuracy Zernike coefficients through intentional overfitting. Experimental results using data from aspheric mirror show that ZernikeNet can effectively remove low-order aberrations, leaving only high-order aberrations, resulting in a low residual SFE RMS value. This method offers a significant advantage over traditional Zernike polynomial fitting approaches for optical components with complex shapes, making it a promising tool for the design and analysis of advanced optical systems.

### Suppressing effects of micro-vibration for MTF measurement of high-resolution electro-optical satellite payload in an optical alignment ground facility

Optics Express · Jan 26, 2023

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1364%2FOE%2E481339&urlhash=_R_S&isSdui=true)

Sensitivity to micro-vibration generated in an optical alignment ground facility increases with the optical aperture of the electro-optical payload mounted on the remote sensing satellite. The micro-vibration distorts the edge spread function (ESF) and changes the modulation transfer function (MTF) value during MTF measurements. Here, an ESF reconstruction network (ESFNet) is proposed to reconstruct the ESF distorted by micro-vibration. A proxy ground-truth ESF dataset for stable training of the proposed ESFNet via a supervised learning method is introduced. The proposed method is robust against both overfitting and underfitting for distorted parts of the ESF caused by micro-vibration. Experiments using ESF obtained in the facility with real micro-vibration show that the measurement error of MTF is around 0.02% when the ESFs are reconstructed using the proposed ESFNet.

### Automotive Vision Camera System based on Neuromorphic Processor

This book describes automotive vision camera systems to provide road scene information necessary for autonomous driving vehicles to plan driving routes and establish driving rules. For this purpose, a lane detection system and a traffic sign recognition (TSR) system, which can be implemented by an image sensor alone, were designed based on a neuromorphic processor and evaluated through the experiments. The vision camera system for autonomous driving vehicles must ensure the stability of the system for the safety of the driver and also the flexibility of the system for high recognition accuracy. In this book, in order to achieve the stability and flexibility of the automotive system, the neuromorphic network input was diversified into pixel values or statistical pattern vectors of the original image according to the pattern characteristics of the lanes and the traffic signs.

This letter describes the development and implementation of the lane detection system accelerated by the neuromorphic hardware. Because the neuromorphic hardware has inherently parallel nature and has constant output latency regardless the size of the knowledge, the proposed lane detection system can recognize various types of lanes quickly and efficiently. Experimental results using the road images obtained in the actual driving environments showed that white and yellow lanes could be detected with an accuracy of more than 94 percent.

### Traffic Sign Recognition based on the Neuromorphic System

IEICE transactions on Information and Systems (submitted) · Sep 7, 2017

A traffic sign recognition (TSR) based on the neuromorphic system is proposed. Compared to the traditional TSR approaches used in previous studies, the main advantage of the proposed TSR is that traffic sign identification can be achieved with the relatively small amount of computation without using existing image processing algorithms. A simple feature description technique using a shape profile vector is introduced to effectively detect the traffic sign candidate areas. The shape profile vector is generated by connecting the vertical direction average values and the horizontal direction average values in the feature points. The proposed TSR system performs the traffic sign candidate area search using the shape profile vectors and performs the pattern recognition on the candidate areas based on the knowledge of the traffic sign contents to output the final identification result. At this time, the candidate area search and the pattern recognition are performed and accelerated by the neuromorphic system. As results of the experiments using images obtained from actual road driving, the proposed TSR system can detect the traffic sign candidate areas with 87 % accuracy and identify the speed limit signs with 75 % accuracy.

### Nonuniformity correction scheme considering the effects of internal thermal stray light

Optical Engineering (SPIE) · Jan 11, 2017

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Espiedigitallibrary%2Eorg%2Fjournals%2FOptical_Engineering%2Fvolume-56%2Fissue-1%2F013104%2FNonuniformity-correction-scheme-considering-the-effects-of-internal-thermal-stray%2F10%2E1117%2F1%2EOE%2E56%2E1%2E013104%2Efull&urlhash=u9-x&isSdui=true)

A stray light compensated nonuniformity correction (SLCNUC) method is proposed for infrared (IR) cameras. The proposed approach formulates thermal stray light compensation functions according to the internal temperature changes of the IR camera. To derive the compensation functions, we analyze the variations of the NUC parameters over the entire range of internal temperatures and determine the function coefficients by using a least squares method. Compared with the existing NUC methods used in previous studies, the major advantage of the proposed method is its effective reduction of nonuniformity even in highly accumulated thermal stray light situations. Experiments and comparisons performed with real IR images show that the proposed method maintains lower spatial noise over a wide internal temperature range of the IR camera. It is shown that the proposed NUC achieves an 18 dB higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than that of the conventional reference-based NUC method.

### An Active Broadband Noise Control System based on the Multiband-Structured Delayless Subband Adaptive Filter

Journal of Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers · Mar 1, 2010

[Show publication](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edbpia%2Eco%2Ekr%2FJournal%2FArticleDetail%2FNODE01395558&urlhash=cvIv&isSdui=true)

This paper proposes a new active noise control (ANC) system for canceling broadband noise. The proposed ANC system is designed based on the multiband-structured delayless subband adaptive filter (MDSAF), which has advantages of fast-convergence speed and higher noise reduction performance by eliminating the aliasing and band-edge effects caused by band-partitioning. The simulation results show that the proposed ANC system has faster convergence speed as compared to the conventional ANC systems and effectively reduces the wideband noise.
